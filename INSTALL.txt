Use git to clone the scripts to anywhere in your home directory:

cd ~
git clone git://github.com/Coornail/Php-analysis.git phpanalysis

The scripts uses the phpanalysis_path enviromental variable to locate the
helper scripts. So you propably want to add it to your .bashrc:

phpanalysis_path=~/phpanalysis
export $phpanalysis_path

Then you can use it as: ~/phpanalysis/phpcheck myphp.php
