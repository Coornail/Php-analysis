  PHP Syntax check and static analysis tools
 

These scripts are helpers to always commit the best possible php code to your
repository.

I organize these tools to enforce best practices primarily for Drupal, but it
can be used for any php project.

Dependencies:
 * rats (http://www.fortifysoftware.com/security-resources/rats.jsp) [optional]
 * Phpdoc (http://pear.php.net/PhpDocumentor) [optional]
 * Write permission to /tmp [if phpdoc is installed]

The project is under development, and it was made for me personally, so it's
not very general (working on it as I said =).

I appreciate every help I get with the repository, or ideas about what 
else to include.
