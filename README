  PHP Syntax check and static analysis tools
 

These scripts are helpers to always commit the best possible php code to your
repository.

I organize these tools to enforce best practices primarily for Drupal, but it
can be used for any php project.

Dependencies:
 * php
 * Write permission to /tmp [if phpdoc is installed]
 * php exec() permission [for pre-commit hook, it's enough only for the php-cli]

The script can use:
 * rats (http://www.fortifysoftware.com/security-resources/rats.jsp)
 * Phpdoc (http://pear.php.net/PhpDocumentor)
 * Coder Drupal module (http://drupal.org/project/drush ,
     http://drupal.org/project/coder) [drush has to be aliased]

I appreciate every help I get with the repository, or ideas about what 
else to include.
